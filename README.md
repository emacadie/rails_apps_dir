This repo will hold any Rails apps that I got from http://railsapps.github.io/  

As of 2020-05-04, it will also hold my Ruby apps.    

I am trying to clean up my github account and consolidate repos.    

It will also hold other Rails apps I have on github. I am spending more time on Groovy and Grails.   

Insert "Yo dawg, I heard you like" joke here.   

If there is not much in the master branch, try another branch.
