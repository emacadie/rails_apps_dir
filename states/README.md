# States

TODO: Write a gem description  

This is just a gem I wrote to see if I could write a gem. I followed steps on some web site to do this.  
I also wanted to put some classes in a file tree to work with modules and namespaces.  

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'states'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install states
